Description: Implements fast algorithms for solving the multivariate
  normal means problem via empirical Bayes. The method is closely
  related to statistical aapproaches for multivariate density
  deconvolution, so it can also be viewed as a method for multivariate
  density deconvolution. The multivariate normal means model is also a
  useful special case of the "Extreme Deconvolution" model
